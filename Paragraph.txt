Bill Gates wrote about change that would come to businesses. 
People often falsely predict big changes to come in short periods of time, but don’t give as much consideration for longer time changes, which are 
the actual big changes. He said that you should not be caught off guard when the real big changes come and then struggle 
keeping up. According to Gates, the big change to business was coming with the internet. Businesses were going to expand once they establish a customer base, start advertising and selling different types of products, and increasingly in wider ranges with the growth of the business. Gates urged to learn about the internet, and use it for your business. Because within ten years, most costumers would make shift to the online lifestyle.
